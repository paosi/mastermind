# mastermind

This is a game where a player tries to guess a 4-digit number combination. At the end of each
attempt to guess the 4-digit number combination, the computer will provide feedback whether the
player guessed a number in the combination correctly, and/or a number and it's exact location in the combination correctly. A player must guess
the correct combination within 10 attempts to win the game.
